# Introduction


My name is Abrar Tarafder
I am currently a first year student at UOIT
Ever since I started taking computer science classes and learning about coding I have been passionate about creating my own projects
Although very new to coding I wanted to start off with basics so I have done two very simple projects
The first being implementing binary search and insert sort algorithms from pseudo code learned in class 
I am currently learning c++ and Python 
In the future, I want to implement a hangman game, preferably a very simple calculator and more games like the snake game and mad libs.
